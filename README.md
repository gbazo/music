# Music generation using markov chains with viterbi algorithm in R and Python.

The objective of this work is to generate possible reproductive musical compositions from mathematical models using tools such as R and Python.

It was developed as a requirement for discipline completion.

An example of worked sound is available, this result was achieved by a joint work between the generation of the algorithm and improvements made by the teacher.
